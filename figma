Figma is a design tool that allows you to create user interfaces, including web page layouts. While I can't directly create a Figma design here, I can guide you through the process of creating a simple student bio data layout using Figma.

Create a Figma Account:

If you don't have a Figma account, you'll need to sign up at https://www.figma.com/.
Create a New File:

Once you're logged in, create a new file by clicking on the "+" button in the top left corner and choosing "New File."
Design Your Layout:

Use Figma's design tools to create a layout similar to the HTML structure I provided earlier.
Add Text Elements:

Use the "T" key to add text elements for the student's name, age, major, hobbies, and GitHub link.
Style Your Design:

Customize the font, colors, and layout according to your preferences. Figma provides a variety of styling options.
Create Sections:

Use frames or groups to organize different sections of your bio data, such as personal information, hobbies, and GitHub link.
Add Links:

If you want to make the GitHub link clickable, you can use the "Text" tool to create a hyperlink. Select the text, click on the "Create Link" icon in the right panel, and provide the GitHub URL.
Preview Your Design:

Use Figma's preview mode to see how your design looks. This can help you identify any adjustments needed.
Share Your Design:

Once you're satisfied with your design, you can share it with others. Click on the "Share" button in the top right corner and generate a shareable link.fi
