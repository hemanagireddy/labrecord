I can guide you through the process of creating a table design using Figma. Since I can't directly create or display Figma designs, I'll provide step-by-step instructions.

Open Figma:

If you don't have a Figma account, sign up at https://www.figma.com/.
Once logged in, create a new project.
Create a Frame:

Click on the "Frame" tool in the toolbar or press F to create a frame.
Drag to draw a frame on the canvas. This will be the container for your table.
Draw a Rectangle for the Table:

Select the "Rectangle" tool in the toolbar or press R.
Draw a rectangle within the frame to represent your table.
Divide the Rectangle:

Use the "Line" tool or "Pen" tool to draw lines within the rectangle, dividing it into rows and columns.
Style the Table:

Select the rectangle and customize its properties in the right sidebar:
Adjust the fill color (if needed).
Set the stroke color and thickness for borders.
Add any other styling details you want.
Add Text for Table Headers and Cells:

Use the "Text" tool or press T to add text for table headers and cells.
Position the text within the respective rows and columns.
Style Text and Headers:

Customize the text properties in the right sidebar:
Set the font, size, and color.
Adjust the alignment.
Adjust Cell Heights and Widths:

Click and drag the edges of the table cells to adjust their heights and widths.
Add Additional Elements (Optional):

You can add icons, buttons, or other elements to enhance your table design.
Preview and Share:

Use the "Play" button in the top right corner to preview your design.
Share the design by clicking on the "Share" button in the top right corner.
Remember, these instructions provide a basic guide for creating a table in Figma. You can further customize the design based on your specific needs and preferences. Figma is a powerful design tool with many features, so feel free to explore and experiment with different elements to create the perfect table for your project.
